# Comparative_study
Comparative study for deep learning frameworks to test which framework works out to be the best for beginners.


##Project Description:

#Authors :
1. Aditya R. Karmarkar (karma@udel.edu)
2. Abdullah Alnajim (alnajim@udel.edu)
3. Abdulrahman Alshammari (aturqi@kudel.edu)

Start date : 03/31/2017
End date : 05/05/2017
Frameworks to be studied :
1. Torch
2. Tensorflow
3. Caffe
4. deeplearning4j
5. Theano
6. CNTK

Fields to be considered under this study:
1. Computationl Biology
2. GeoPhysics
3. Statistics
4. Classical ML
5. Imaging 

#Aim :
Study deep learning frameworks and create guidelines for beginners to use such frameworks. Also, try to rate frameworks based on their usage, simplicity and avalability of documentation.


#Methodology :
1. Learn and sort framework according to popularity within the community
2. Pick up dataset to create models using frameworks (More the datasets, comparison can be distinct).
3. Try to generalize the models so that complexity of framework can be analysed.
4. Based on complexity and learning time spent on each framework can be plotted to draw picture of simplicity acroos framework learning.
5. Conclude

#Results:
TBA

#Conclusion:
TBA
